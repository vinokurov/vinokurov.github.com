30 May -- 3 June 2011 the annual conference "Days on Diffraction 2011":http://www.imi.ras.ru/~dd/index.php will take place in St.&nbsp;Petersburg, Russia.

The aim of the event is to bring together scientists working in the area of mathematical theory of waves' diffraction and propagation and researchers interested in application of various nature wave phenomena. We are always pleased to see active researchers from all over the world!

Traditionally the following topics are presented:

* Mathematical aspects of wave propagation
* Scattering and diffraction
* Sound propagation and vibration
* Nonlinear waves
* Inverse problems
* Non-stationary phenomena
* Asymptotic techniques
* Electromagnetics
* Elastic waves and seismology
* Microwave and quantum waveguides
* Numerical approaches
* Wavelets and applications 

Abstract submission "deadline":http://www.imi.ras.ru/~dd/deadlines.php is 7 Feb, 2011.
